         <p> The Lotus is Indias national flower. It represents the history and cultural heritage of our country. It is an aquatic plant that grows in ponds, damp soil or lakes. It grows in direct sunlight and can absorb temperatures up to 25-30 degrees. Lotus are in different colours like pink, red, blue and white. The flower is a symbol of purity, knowledge and wealth. Lotus is found in sub-tropical regions, primarily in the Southeast Asian countries. 
        The Lotuss boat-like petals and floating leaves make it a unique and beautiful sight. It is a common sight in holy ceremonies and worship, where it is used for decoration, adding a touch of natural beauty to these sacred occasions.

         <p> My favourite flower is the rose. It is known as the flower of love across the world. Roses can be found in different colours like red, white, pink, yellow, etc. The rose petals are soft and delicate. Roses grow on shrubs and have little thorns on their stems. The leaves of the rose plants are generally round and deep green. The fruit of the rose plant is known as rosehip. Rose is called the king of flowers. Roses can be found all across India. In aroma shops, you can find rose fragrances. Roses, with their myriad uses, play a significant role in celebrations. They are a symbol of love and a source of food essence, rose water, and beauty products like rose fresher and perfumes. In Indian restaurants, you will find rose-based milkshakes, syrups, sweets and falooda served for dessert. The flower is famously used to make garlands for weddings or worship in temples. The different human emotions associated with rose flowers add a touch of sentiment to these celebrations. The yellow rose symbolises friendship and caring, while white roses symbolise purity, and pink roses symbolise joy and happiness. Rose Day, celebrated on the 7th of February each year, is a testament to the flowers role in spreading love and joy. </p>
